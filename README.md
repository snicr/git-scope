## Overview

**git-scope** is a terminal-based dashboard that helps you manage multiple git repositories. It scans your configured directories, shows you which repos have uncommitted changes, and lets you jump into your editor with a single keystroke.

### Features

- 🔍 **Fuzzy Search**: Find any repo by name, path, or branch with `/`
- 🛡️ **Dirty Filter**: Press `f` to see only repos with uncommitted changes
- ⚡ **Fast caching**: Instant startup using JSON caching
- 📊 **Dashboard**: Shows branch, staged/unstaged counts, and last commit
- ⌨️ **Keyboard-driven**: Vim-like navigation (`j`/`k`) and sorting (`s`)
- 🚀 **Quick Jump**: Open any repo in your editor (VSCode, nvim, etc.) with `Enter`
